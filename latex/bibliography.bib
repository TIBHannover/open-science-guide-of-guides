abstract = {Open science initiatives, which are often collaborative efforts focused on making research more transparent, have experienced increasing popularity in the past decade. Open science principles of openness {and} transparency provide opportunities to advance diversity, justice, {and} sustainability by promoting diverse, just, {and} sustainable outcomes among both undergraduate {and} senior researchers. We review models that demonstrate the importance of greater diversity, justice, {and} sustainability in psychological science before describing how open science initiatives promote these values. Open science initiatives also promote diversity, justice, {and} sustainability through increased levels of inclusion {and} access, equitable distribution of opportunities {and} dissemination of knowledge, {and} increased sustainability stemming from increased generalizability. In order to provide an application of the concepts discussed, we offer a set of diversity, justice, {and} sustainability lens questions for individuals to use while assessing research projects {and} other organizational systems {and} consider concrete classroom applications for these initiatives.},

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, thousands of citizen science projects engaging millions of participants in collecting and/or processing data have sprung up around the world. Here we review documented outcomes from four categories of citizen science projects which are defined by the nature of the activities in which their participants engage – Data Collection, Data Processing, Curriculum-based, {and} Community Science. We find strong evidence that scientific outcomes of citizen science are well documented, particularly for Data Collection {and} Data Processing projects. We find limited but growing evidence that citizen science projects achieve participant gains in knowledge about science knowledge {and} process, increase public awareness of the diversity of scientific research, {and} provide deeper meaning to participants’ hobbies. We also find some evidence that citizen science can contribute positively to social well-being by influencing the questions that are being addressed {and} by giving people a voice in local environmental decision making. While not all citizen science projects are intended to achieve a greater degree of public understanding of science, social change, or improved science -society relationships, those projects that do require effort {and} resources in four main categories: (1) project design, (2) outcomes measurement, (3) engagement of new audiences, {and} (4) new directions for research.},
